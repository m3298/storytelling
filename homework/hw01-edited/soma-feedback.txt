if the whole design needs rethinking then i recommend just starting another project, because i think it looks fine

okay so the highlight
don't do the border thing, instead dim the non-outlined ones
where the lines hit the bars, try putting a little circle
i'm contemplating whether you should extend a line to the left on the bottom so it isn't hanging alone
make sure all of your lines are the same weight
i feel like "The U.S. drops.." is larger than the other text, but maybe it's not? maybe drop the size of all of the annotations a bit so they stand out from the subhead (even though i was so adamant about font sizes)
i feel like year should be bolded instead of the number but i reallydon't know

smaller version: this is cumulative, right? so you can have a bar between '52 and '68
maybe add a little breathing room on the right hand side between the bar and the ticks

on the smallest one, align the text with the start of the bars, not with the years
except for 1945
(i give you permission to wrap the text)
(i thought your non-simple-bars version of the middle size was fine, although i didn't look too closely)
