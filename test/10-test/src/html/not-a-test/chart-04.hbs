    <h3>Chart 4: Dynamic bar graph</h3>

      If you find something especially hard, or your code keeps breaking, just hit undo until your graph kind of works and skip to the next part or problem.

    <p>This chart should also be a bar graph using <code>animal-counts.csv</code>, but the y axis and bar widths should automatically update if we change in new data.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Should look the same as above</li>
      <li>If you change the dataset to <code>animal-counts-2.csv</code>, it should still work</li>
    </ul>

      <p><strong>Hints:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>You should probably cut and paste from the last graph, but remember to change from <code>chart-03</code> to <code>chart-04</code></li>
        <li>It will probably look a little different than Chart 3, don't worry</li>
        <li>You'll want to update your scale domains after reading in your data</li>
        <li>If your bars look too long, remember D3 reads everything in as strings so you need to do a little something extra</li>
        <li>Test by switching between <code>animal-counts.csv</code> and <code>animal-counts-2.csv</code></li>
      </ul>
