    <ul>
      <li>Hovering over a player should put a black border around their circle</li>
      <li>Hovering over a player should display their name and team name to the right</li>
      <li>Clicking on a button should highlight those kinds of players (you can decide what that means)</li>

      <ul>
        <li>Remember to change from <code>chart-01</code> to <code>chart-06</code></li>
        <li>You'll want to make the graphic more narrow</li>
        <li><code>hover</code> is <strong>not</strong> an event</li>
        <li><code>Team</code> is the column for the team name</li>
        <li>You'll need to edit the HTML to be able to change the 'player name' and 'team name' sections, as well as listen for clicks on the buttons.</li>
