ai2html:
- what to do if graphics that look nice in Illustrator get cut off on websites, etc
- make sure you're using the right font -- font type in AI matches font type on website

CHANGING FONT:
https://gist.github.com/jsoma/631621e0807b26d49f5aef5260f79162

- create ai2html-config.json file
- put it in the same directory as ai2html.js
- inside ai2html-config.json, add font info
- script > other script > run ai2html.json

- embed link from Google Font

3D stuff
- Blender (free 3D modeling)
- 3.js (how blender objects get put on the website)

SVG
- you can take SVG off from a website and paste onto AI if you copy element of the SVG
- if it's SVG, it's probably made in D3

When inspecting page:
JS >> search for .js files in source code
- .min.js files >> 'minimised'; gets rid of blank spaces etc, making your code v hard to read and making the file smaller
- On Inspector, go to Console, and run: document.querySelectorAll('svg')

- build system turns nice CSS/JS into unreadable, minimised versions

CACHE BUSTER
- a string of numbers after a .js file
- every time config.js changes, it gets renamed with a string of numbers so that the computer knows it's an updated .js file
