Reviewing: Weird node stuff

1) What command do you need to run when you first download/use a new node.js project?

npm install

2) What does -g do when using it to install a package?

"globally" - installs across our entire system

3) What is package.json?

Everything the computer needs to know about the node.js project - mostly we're interested in the modules (or packages) that our project needs

4) What is a dependency?

just another word for a module that our code depends on


5) What is node_modules?

the folder where npm installs all of the modules listed in package.json


6) What is .eslintrc.json?

linting - process of automatedly cleaning your code
eslint - the linter that we use for javascript
the setup for our coding style

ECMAScript
eslint
jslint

7) Name two things a build system might do.


function () {
  var myName = "Soma";
  console.log(myName);
}

function(){var a="Soma";console.log(a);}

minification/obfuscates
allows your code to be run ny older browsers - polyfills, transpilation from es6
concatenate your code - combine different js files into one file
cache busting - graphic.js -> graphic.uh3983.js

taking your development code -> turning into production code


8) Name one build system we don’t use.

webpack
grunt
gulp
babel (not really)

9) We’ve used something called parcel and we’ve used something called sawhorse. What’s the difference between them?

parcel -> html/css/js magic -> it's a build system
sawhorse -> template for building d3-driven or ai2html-ing websites

sawhorse uses parcel as its build system, but it also uses a lot other things


10) What is Handlebars? What does Handlebars code look like?

{{ }}

templating language

works inside of HTML

<h1>{{ title }}</h1>
<h1>This is your homework</h1>

11) Name 3 JavaScript events.

.on('click', function() {
})

.on('mouseover', function() {
})

.on('mouseout', function() {
})


12) What’s the difference between function (d) and d =>?

d => is from the future
you have to use function (d) if you want to edit the thing that was clicked/hovered by using d3.select(this)

13) In d3, how do you select something with the class name of blarble? How do you select something with the id of gnarblet? 

d3.select(".blarble")
d3.select("#gnarblet")
