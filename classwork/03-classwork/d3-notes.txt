Scale questions
For each scale, you need to determine the domain (inputs) and range (outputs).

Evenly space out the cities. Where is Moscow?
	scale = d3.scalePoint().domain(names).range([0, width])
	scale('Moscow')

The biggest city is red. What color is Jakarta?
	scale = d3.scaleLinear().domain([0, maxPop]).range(['white','red'])
	scale(9.5)

The biggest city is on the right-hand side. Where is Washington, DC?
The biggest city has a radius of 300 pixels. How big is Moscow?
